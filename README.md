## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### Self-assessment

#### What I learnt

- I solidified my DOM manipulation proficency
- I practiced JS a lot more than I expected (üëçüèæ)
- I used regex validation for the first time
- It was surprisingly harder than [my calculator project](https://github.com/RalphPastel972/-01--Calculatrice)

#### What I am proud of

I feel I leveled up with this one! I had to tackle many unplanned challenges.
It works well.

#### What I would do differently

I would think ahead of time of all the use cases and edge cases. That would have saved me a lot of time.
For the first time I felt overwhelmed by the size of my CSS file: I need to start using Saas or to learn a framework that makes my life easier.

#### Challenges

- My estimating skills are bad: Originally, I estimated I could do it in just 8 hours. Let's just say it took me way longer.
- As I didn't have a clear vision beforehand, my code started to be spagettified. I still need to refactor it! I know!
- I wasted a lot of time trying to implement a way to prevent the user to type forbidden character when at the end, a simple regex validation is good enough IMHO.

#### Help needed

- Any advice on the best way to refactor my JS code
- How to organise my CSS file better?
